### Brainstorm

- 10+ years developing C/C++ applications ranging from custom python extensions to full-fledged spacecraft flight software (Perseverance Mars Rover).
- Have developed using VxWorks (M2020; Perseverance before its official naming), GreenHills (Psyche, Europa Clipper), and FreeRTOS (FPrime) and have enjoyed the differences they offer.
- Hand-in-hand coordination with Systems Engineering, Ground Data Systems, Simulation, and all necessary stakeholders is pivotal to the successful development of a spacecraft's flight software. 
- Adherence to (and procedural updating of) the Mission's design documents, requirements set, and interface specifications is also critical to ensure all the teams working on the mission can integrate their products to a final spacecraft that performs as intended with behavior compliant to all the initial requirements and use cases.
- After a minimum viable subset of the overall mission product is available to be tested in a strict Hardware Integration testbed... ATLO
- I've been involved as Cognizant Engineer, technical lead, and individual contributor on several software teams taking systems through their full software lifecycle. 
- This experience has informed each phase of the lifecycle for subsequent missions, e.g. being initially mindful to create an architecture modular, flexible, and resilient for future patching that might be required post-deployment.
- I am an energetic, adaptive, and forward thinking Software Systems Engineer with almost 20 years of experience developing innovative solutions and products in the realms of Radar, Missiles, Space, and interplanetary exploration. I have collaborated with Lockheed Martin engineers during my career and have always been impressed by their professionalism, technical acumen, and fast-paced problem solving.

### Draft

Dear Lockheed Martin Hiring Team,


It has been my privilege to help develop enterprise-level missions and flagship space vehicles at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the past 8 years. 
I contributed significantly to the RTOS flight software, integration and test, ground data system, and simulation aspects of each mission I have worked on.
I am an energetic, adaptive, and forward thinking Software Systems Engineer with almost 20 years of experience developing innovative solutions and products in the realms of Radar, Missiles, Space, and interplanetary exploration. 
I have collaborated with Lockheed Martin engineers during my career and have always been impressed by their professionalism, technical acumen, and fast-paced problem solving.
I am excited to continue my technical journey by contributing and growing at Lockheed Martin -- an industry leader with a proven track record ever advancing the frontiers of science. 

Over the course of my career, I have been involved as Cognizant Engineer, technical lead, and individual contributor on several software teams taking systems through their full software lifecycle -- from early-phase trade studies and ICD development to critical design reviews and software development through flight operations and maintenance. 
Throughout these phases, I try to incorporate current industry standards and modern technical solutions. 
On the Mars 2020 mission, I helped implement a broad CI/CD DevOps pipeline to build Docker images and auto-deploy AWS GovCloud environments for 80+ subsystem component functionalities using Jenkins, Docker, and terraform. 
I also architected, developed, and utilized an automated testing framework to validate the fault recovery requirements of a mission-critical build of flight software for Martian Entry Descent and Landing (EDL). This architecture is the foundation of automated testing for subsequent JPL missions.

Beyond technical expertise, my greatest strength is leadership: cultivating trust, driving clarity, and helping teams exceed expectations.
I welcome the opportunity to bring this mindset and positive mental attitude to Lockheed Martin.
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I’d be thrilled to speak further about how I can support your programs and development efforts.


Sincerely,

Luke Stewart
