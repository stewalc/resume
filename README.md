# Resume


## TODO

Quick feedback on the resume:
 
I am not a big fan of objectives, especially generic ones. 
I’d throw that out and consider a cover letter instead when applying to a specific job
“engineering discipline lines” to “engineering disciplines” will save you space
I think the last two bullets in the “Intangibles” are a little generic. Consider revising to be more specific to space (for a space job like Firefly)


Technical Skills
Glad you have this (Bill, the hiring manager was surprised I didn’t have one)
Consider putting the things the company is looking for first one your list (e.g. Python, Go). I see it is alphabetical, but that wasn’t initial obvious to me. What I usually see on resumes is things in the order of proficiency or importance
Do you have any WebApp UI framework experience (React, Vue, Svelte?) If so, get that in there

Same goes for “Applications”. You could even consider splitting these out a bit more into categories (e.g. Frameworks, Databases, Space Domain Applications). Look at some example resumes and see what you like the most.

Professional Experience
I personally get a little lost in the bullet points. 
They don’t have consistency in style (e.g. sometimes a bullet represents a position and sometimes it represents a project you worked on). 
The content in there is detailed and great, but it could be tightened up to be less confusing (in all honestly, consider using ChatGPT to help you with that a bit)
For example – here is how you could clean up one of your bullets: “Integrate YAMCS mission control framework (Java) into JPL missions to establish a NASA-wide Common Mission Control Ground Data System (GDS), which requires a deep understanding of CCSDS packets, frames, and Space Link Extension (SLE) interfaces”

For your Raytheon work, use past tense since that was a previous role
I wouldn’t use a bullet that is completely a parenthesis: “(Also fixed the need for a“split” solution while implementing it – provided an all-RHEL7 runtime solution”


Special Activities and Awards
They look a little dinky at the bottom – I would try to find a way to fill up a little more whitespace with them (maybe include the year or something)
 
I have attached my resume and cover letter for reference if you would find that helpful, but as I noted, I think I would have added a “technical skills” to mine. If you don’t mind updating this ASAP, then I will send it to the Firefly hiring manager (resume and no cover letter is probably fine)
