%Salutation
\normalsize Dear Lockheed Martin Hiring Team,

% Letter body
% \small \noindent
It has been my privilege to help develop enterprise-level missions and flagship space vehicles at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the past 8 years. 
I contributed significantly to the RTOS flight software, integration and test, ground data system, and simulation aspects of each mission I have worked on.
I am an energetic, adaptive, and forward thinking Software Systems Engineer with almost 20 years of experience developing innovative solutions and products in the realms of Radar, Missiles, Space, and interplanetary exploration. 

\vspace{1pt}

I have collaborated with Lockheed Martin engineers during my career and have always been impressed by their professionalism, technical acumen, and fast-paced problem solving.
I am excited to continue my technical journey by contributing and growing at Lockheed Martin -- an industry leader with a proven track record ever advancing the frontiers of science. 

\vspace{1pt}

Over the course of my career, I have been involved as Cognizant Engineer, technical lead, and individual contributor on several software teams taking systems through their full software lifecycle -- from early-phase trade studies and ICD development to critical design reviews and software development through flight operations and maintenance. 
Throughout these phases, I try to incorporate current industry standards and modern technical solutions. 
On the Mars 2020 mission, I helped implement a broad CI/CD DevOps pipeline to build Docker images and auto-deploy AWS GovCloud environments for 80+ subsystem component functionalities using Jenkins, Docker, and terraform. 
I also architected, developed, and utilized an automated testing framework to validate the fault recovery requirements of a mission-critical build of flight software for Martian Entry Descent and Landing (EDL). This architecture is the foundation of automated testing for subsequent JPL missions.

\vspace{1pt}

Beyond technical expertise, my greatest strength is leadership: cultivating trust, driving clarity, and helping teams exceed expectations.
I welcome the opportunity to bring this mindset and positive mental attitude to Lockheed Martin.
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I'd be thrilled to speak further about how I can support your programs and development efforts.

\bigskip
\noindent
Sincerely,\\
\textbf{Luke Stewart}
