## **Professional Experience**
--------
### [**NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory**](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) -- Pasadena, California USA
*Software Systems Engineer III* **May 2019 to present**
- Currently working in Mission Control Information Systems (393C).
- Cognizant Engineer (CogE) -- [Psyche Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) OpenMCT](https://dsocmct.jpl.nasa.gov/). Locally deployed (Podman containers) at Ground Laser Transmit (GLT) and Ground Laser Receive (GLR) Antennas with real-time synchronized telemetry to AWS deployed (GovCloud; JPL Net) custom OpenMCT adaptation with RethinkDB (real-time) and InfluxDB (time series; historical) data management running with automated telemetry processing and replication. The AWS RESTFul endpoint provides necessary real-time Psyche pass telemetry observation for all mission stakeholders.
- [Multiple Uplink Per Antenna (MUPA) Space Link Extension (SLE) Forward CLTU (FCLTU) Service Multiplexer (FMUX)](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/MUPA/fmux). Python-based novel approach for multiplexing CLTUs allowing one DSN antenna to service multiple spacecrafts' uplink needs.
- Common Mission Control (CMC). Integrating [YAMCS](https://github.com/yamcs/yamcs) mission control framework (Java) into JPL missions in an effort to establish a NASA-wide Common Mission Control Ground Data System (GDS). Requires meticulous understanding and debugging of CCSDS packets/frames processing (uplink and downlink) as well as automated Space Link Extension (SLE) interfaces
- [Psyche PassAutomation](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/stewartl/Pass_Automation). Python program currently used by Psyche, Europa Clipper, and other Earth-orbiting missions to automatically initiate space antenna station connection and downlink processing using AMPCS driven by DSN (SPS) track scheduling. Supports passes on the DSN in addition to the NEN and SN.
- Actively supported Mars 2020 (Perseverance Rover; Ingenuity Drone) automated execution and analysis of Second Chance (SECC) FSW to ensure successful Martian Entry Descent and Landing (EDL). This uses my framework for automated and distributed execution of FSW simulation across 50 servers to complete 450 individual test cases.
- Created a self-contained automated Docker orchestration framework to launch and interact with AMPCS (Ground Control Software), Vista (a NASA OpenMCT plugin for telemetry visualization), and cFS (Core Flight System; an open-source flight software framework)/FPrime (a flight-proven, multi-platform, open-source flight software framework) to demonstrate Mission Control System's full suite of functionality with a simple, user-facing emphasis.
- Helped implement a Continuous Integration pipeline for Mars 2020 CS3 (Common Software and Services Subsystem) to build Docker images and auto-deploy AWS (Amazon Web Services) GovCloud environments for 80+ subsystem component functionalities using Jenkins, Docker, and terraform.

### [**Raytheon Company**](http://www.raytheon.com/) -- Pasadena, California USA
*Principal Software Engineer* **June 2017 to April 2019**
- Develop, Execute, and Review Functional Integration Tests (FIT) for Mars 2020 Flight Software.
- Implemented updates to existing Python Test Framework (PTF) to run the simulation in "split" mode (distributed across 2 servers; RHEL5 and RHEL7).
- (Also fixed the need for a"split" solution while implementing it -- provided an all-RHEL7 runtime solution)
- Concurrently adapted the "split" and "RHEL7-unified" solutions for NISAR, SMAP, Psyche, and Europa Clipper Missions (for some Multi-Mission design/architecture experience)
- Architected and passionately implemented a Continuous Integration
- Automated Testing Solution for Mars 2020 (WART).

### [**Raytheon Company**](http://www.raytheon.com/) -- Aurora, Colorado USA
*Systems Engineer* **August 2010 to June 2017**
- GPS OCX automation/integration specialist.
- GPS OCX System Simulator (GSYS) developer, integrator, and subject matter expert.
- Worked with Digital Defense Services (DDS) to integrate DevOps mentality and practices into the GPS OCX Program.
- Subject matter expert for JPL program code (RTGx Kalman Filter; Trajedy astrodynamics propagator).
- Successfully extended python with the JPL C++ libraries (developed necessary C++ API wrappers).
- Implemented Distributed Computing framework for analysis/execution using parallel processing (C++ \[an IPC methodology\]) and MapReduce (modular Distributed Computing) techniques.
- Helped wrap and debug real-time Satellite Flight Software (C++ and ADA compiled with GreenHills and GNAT Pro/AdaCore, respectively) to interact within the GSYS Simulation Framework.
- Integrator for GSYS and GPS OCX Operational Baseline (MCS). Played critical role in driving the OCX operational software with GSYS.
- Developed and implemented the Space Vehicle Dynamics Model (SVDM). An API to the JPL GPS OCX astrodynamics algorithms (C++) used by all simulated Space Vehicle Types in GSYS.
- Developed many utilities on personal time to solve Program Risks (e.g., Automated SW Inventory, DiffSLOC, MP)

### [**Raytheon Company**](http://www.raytheon.com/) -- Woburn, Massachusetts USA
*Systems Engineer* **July 2008 to August 2010**
- Support Analyst at MDIOC in Colorado Springs as AN/TPY-2 radar simulation (CRUSHM) support analyst for the TA-10 event.
- Worked on classified defense contract tasks for simulation, modeling, and analysis of Forward Based X-Band - Transportable (FBX-T) and AN/TPY-2 Radar systems.
- Worked on development and maintenance of CRUSHM radar simulation (C++).
- Prepared, compiled, and installed various releases of CRUSHM on-site at customer locations.
- Helped administer and operate a distributed Linux computing cluster built to expedite CRUSHM radar simulation, Monte Carlo analyses, and genetic algorithm studies.
- Gained valuable insight into the procedural approach to designing/engineering a large scale C++ simulation product -- using UML methodologies -- on a timeline for a government customer.
- Represented my company successfully in engineering design, integration, and support activities conducted in the government customer's classified labs on Redstone Arsenal, AL, and MDIOC Schriever AFB, Colorado Springs, CO.
- Interacted professionally with government customers while hosting simulation training classes.

- Gained extremely useful software knowledge and ability to include Python scripting/automation and C++ model development.
- Designed, ahead of schedule and under-budget, a Control Actuation System open-loop simulation and analysis toolkit.
- Helped design, construct, implement, and operate a distributed computing cluster built solely from excessed PCs and open source software.
